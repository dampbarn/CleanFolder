- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dampbarn
- ðŸ‘€ Folders are a mess, I don't like that.
I have a script which handles the problem. 
  Optimally need develop into more sophisticated software for shareware use. 
Looking for collaboration.  Please, get in   touch with me if interested. 

Can handle huge folders and filetypes pipelined into prenamed .txt, .pdf., docx.- folders. Looks clean and neat in a jiffy.

AB.
