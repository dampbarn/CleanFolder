- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dampbarn
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making an app for clean folders that are a total mess. I have a program that master the task in small folders in matter of a second. 
 I put the files in different spesified files and the useful areas for this would be for big companies or with big folders and repository that need a cleanup and a namedesign that makes sense. 

 If you wanna follow me I will commmit the program in it's current state. I am very much interested in bringing in some new features.
